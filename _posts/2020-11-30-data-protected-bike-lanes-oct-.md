On Wednesday, October 16, BikePGH, in collaboration with the How’s My Driving app, rallied nearly 70 volunteers to disperse along select Pittsburgh bike lanes to count the number of times vehicles were parking, standing, or loading in the bike-only lanes.

Dubbed the “Data Protected Bike Lane Project,” volunteers logged 123 violations, all captured during the morning, lunch and evening rush. Using the How’s My Driving app, a new tool that allows anyone to quickly report dangerous driving behavior, these volunteers covered Forbes Ave (between Bigelow and Morewood), Penn Ave (Stanwix to 11th), Allegheny Circle, and Third Ave (Stanwix to Smithfield).
