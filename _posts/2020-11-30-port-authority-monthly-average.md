This dataset contains the average weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership by route for every month since January 2017. The aggregated ridership data allows quick study of trends over time and identification of problem areas for further analysis.

Bus, light rail (the "T"), and incline ridership data is included.

Routes and bus stops may change at every "pick" or quarterly schedule change in March, June, September, and November.
