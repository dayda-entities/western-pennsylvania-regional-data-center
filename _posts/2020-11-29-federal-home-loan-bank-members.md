The FHLB System was created by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 as a government sponsored enterprise to support mortgage lending and related community investment. It is composed of 12 FHLBanks, more than 8000 member financial institutions, and the System's fiscal agent, the Office of Finance. Each FHLBank is a separate, government-chartered, member-owned corporation.
