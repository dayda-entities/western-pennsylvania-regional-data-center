**Note: This dataset will be used to post updated versions of capital budget deliberative forums into the future.**

Collected responses from surveys distributed at the City of Pittsburgh's Capital Budget Deliberative Forum Meetings. These surveys collected resident sentiment on what capital projects the City should prioritize in the upcoming year.

The collected responses of residents who attended the deliberative meetings concerning the City's 2019 & 2020 Capital Budgets. Residents were asked to identify a specific capital project (or projects) that they felt needed to be completed in their neighborhood. They were asked to be specific as to work needed and the location. They were then asked to use a series of options to note how important they found a list of capital project priorities. Finally, they were asked to share their opinion of the Deliberative Budget Forum by choosing from a series of options.
