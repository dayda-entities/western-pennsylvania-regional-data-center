This dataset lists all bus stops active in Port Authority's fiscal year 2019 (7/1/2018 to 6/30/2019) along with latitude/longitude, stop type and amenities, and average boardings and alightings.

The boardings and alightings are available as an average for the schedule pick and the fiscal year average. A schedule "pick" is a four digit year-month ID for the quarterly schedule period, e.g. 1809 is the schedule period starting September 2018.

Rail stops/stations are not included as riders either pay at the platform (unable to join to specific route) or on the railcar (unable to join to specific platform).
