This compilation includes 8 historical datasets, part of the collection of the Pittsburgh University Library System. Prepared by the Health and Welfare Planning Association, and funded by the Richard King Melon Foundation, the profiles were intended to inform the people, organizations and businesses of Allegheny County about the characteristics of the communities in which they lived, worked and played so they could make better decisions.
